                •    Skill: JUKTI’s aim to surpass the norms of clubs being bound to academics is being achieved by organizing a good number of skill-based workshops annually according to members’ needs. These workshops help to open opportunities, create connections, and especially enhancing skills.

                •    Networking: Growing in practical and technical fields becomes much easier through networking. Through seminars, events, demonstrations, and competitions, JUKTI creates a strong platform to establish a solid network among the freshmen, students, alumni, and teachers.

                •    Placement: In this world of professionalism and competition, finding a station from a Computer Science background can be challenging. Keeping that in mind, JUKTI has taken effective steps by being connected to our alumni, and organizations to help our undergraduates for their placement
